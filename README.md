## [Lists and Time Complexity](Lists/Lists.md)

Is the base needed, a strong understanding, like after IT-Fundamentals

## [Trees](Trees/Trees.md)

[Binary](Trees/Trees.md#binary), [Searching](Trees/Trees.md#searching), [Arbitrary Grade](Trees/Trees.md#arbitrary-grade), [Black&Red](Trees/Trees.md#blackred), [Priority Queue and Heap](Trees/Trees.md#priority-queue-and-heap).

## [Hash](Hash/Hash.md)

Is mostly teory, so at least you should understand what is it's and how it works.

## [Graphs](Graphs/Graphs.md)

[Lists](Graphs/Graphs.md#gaph-lists), [Matrix](Graphs/Graphs.md#gaph-matrix), [Objects](Graphs/Graphs.md#gaph-objects).
