## [Lists and Time Complexity](Lists/Lists.md)

Is the base needed, a strong understanding, like after IT-Fundamentals

[Pointers](Lists/Lists.md#Pointers), [Struct/ADT](Lists/Lists.md#struct-or-adtabstract-data-type), [Stack](Lists/Lists.md#pile-or-stack-), [Queue](Lists/Lists.md#code-or-queue), [Complextity](Lists/Lists.md#complextity).

## [Trees](Trees/Trees.md)

[Binary](Trees/Trees.md#binary), [Serching](Trees/Trees.md#serching), [Arbitrary Grade](Trees/Trees.md#arbitrary-grade), [Black&Red](Trees/Trees.md#blackred).

## [Hash](Hash/Hash.md)

Is mostly teory, so at least you should understand what is it's and how it works.

## [Graphs](Graphs/Graphs.md)

[Lists](Graphs/Graphs.md#gaph-lists), [Matrix](Graphs/Graphs.md#gaph-matrix), [Objects](Graphs/Graphs.md#gaph-objects).

## [Sorting Algorithms](SortingAlgorithms/SortingAlgorithms.md)
