# Problems Complexity
> [!TIP]
> ## Every problem can have a lower or higher bound.
>>     The core is that a problem can be Theta n
>>     Becouse there is a solution that works on Theta n
>>     But every other Solution/Algorithm that is slower still is a solution
> If a solution is faster then a lowebound means:
> - 1 The soulution you found has some kind of errors
> - 2 You have just found a new lowerbound
>
> ## How to define a lowerbound? `Spoiler is kinda hard`
> - Mostly is already asked in the problem
>>     The sum of all numebers till N
>>     Has to be at least Omega N
> *Remember the difference beetween problems that use confronts and the ones who doesn't*
> 
> ### There are NP-Complet problems that can't be solved in polinomial time.
